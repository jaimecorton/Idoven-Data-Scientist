# Data Science Task
This page has details of how I approached the task assigned by **Idoven** for the data scientist job offering.

## What I had to do

We ask data scientist do want to join **Idoven** to work with anonymised patient data, and on the basis of this data be able to:
- Be able to read the _ECG_ files and corresponding annotations
- Show how they will work on the signal and plot the signal in appropriate manner to be read by a doctor
- Identify the heart beat of the signal, average and total heart beat in the signal
- Identify the complex QRS in the signal and been able to annotate on it

As a result we expect a github project with and extructure that will include:
- Reference documentation used
- Jupyter Notebook, in an running environment, Colab, Docker.
- An explanation of the work done and lessons learned.


## Timeframe
It would be great if you could have this done within a week. If that's not doable for you, let us know early.

Also, we don't know how long this should take you, but we're not looking to reward the person that spends the most time on it. We believe in working smarter not harder.

## Tips
In case it's helpful, here's some other tips for you:

You can ask questions. This isn't a "bonus points if they ask questions" thing, just that we'll answer what we can if you need us. Like we would when working together.

We like to have a real work example work flow, we wencorage you to do a pull request and send the pull request for evaluation. 

You can request more information/data, but we'd rather you didn't. If you really need more, let us know, but there'd need to be a compelling reason for it.
## Summary
We want to see what it's like to work with you, and the quality of work you'd produce. This is a chance for both sides to see how that is.

We will be making a decision based on these tests, so do give it your best.

Thanks for giving this a go, we can't wait to see what you come up with.
